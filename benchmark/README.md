This directory contains a benchmark utility for measuring the speed and memory
use of Eips. The benchmarks may also be run with [Diamond Types], another
sequence CRDT implemented in Rust, for comparison.

[Diamond Types]: https://github.com/josephg/diamond-types

For a formatted table of benchmark results, see the end of Eipsâ€™s
[design document](../doc/design.md#benchmark).
