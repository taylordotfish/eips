Eips
====

Eips is the *efficient intention-preserving sequence*. It is a sequence
CRDT with worst-case non-amortized logarithmic-time operations, minimal
memory usage, and no concurrent interleaving issues or duplications from
concurrent moves as seen in other sequence CRDTs.

Serialization
-------------

When the crate feature `serde` is enabled, [`RemoteChange`] (and types it
contains) will implement [Serde]â€™s [`Serialize`] and [`Deserialize`]
traits.
